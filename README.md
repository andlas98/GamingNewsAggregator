# GamingNewsAggregator
Creating a website designed to display recent news from popular gaming sites!

## Why Am I Making This??
... is what you may be asking right now. Well, every other day I peruse through several gaming websites such as Destructoid, Siliconera, and Polygon. Kinda miffed with how many sites I had to open at once, I wondered to myself, "Why not just roll all these sites that you love into one?" And the dream was born...

My inspiration for this site also came from a college friend of mine who is creating a similar aggregator for 100 Days of Code using a subbredit called r/hiphopheads for content. Shoutouts to you, Aaron!

**I look at these for motivation:**

Aaron's website: freshfinder.live

**Basic Functions**
* Potential Languages Required: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, React, Express
* Provide links to various articles related to gaming (a la HackerNews), but personally curated ( thus, not a forum)
* Grab from multiple popular VG sites (Destructoid, Rock Paper Shotgun, Game Informer) and lesser knowns (Siliconera, Eurogamer)
* Should load content from the past week (to keep things minimalistic)
* Filter for different types of articles (reviews, interviews, miscellaneous, reveals/announcements/debuts)

**Later Features**
* Able to whitelist certain sites (Log-in only?)
* Filter by newest articles

## How to Activate the Site Locally
1. Make sure you have NodeJS and ExpressJS installed
2. While in the 'main' directory, call the apps.js folder with "node app.js"
3. A console log will tell you which channel to hop on to...
